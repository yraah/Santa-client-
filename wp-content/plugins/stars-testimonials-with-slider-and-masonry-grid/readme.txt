All of your testimonials will display on mobile devices in a way that’s accessible and legible. 

= Why Testimonials and Reviews Are Important for Business =

It doesn’t matter what industry you’re in – testimonials are an indication of the quality of your products and services. 

A whopping 84% of consumers trust online reviews, which provides them with first-hand knowledge about a brand. If your company has an onslaught of negative online reviews, then your business will suffer tremendously. 

This is because the majority of online users are using Google to find info about a brand before doing business with them. About 82% of smartphone users consult with the web before making a purchase in-store. 

But it’s not just in-store purchases online reviews affect.  Eighty-eight percent of consumers conduct online searches before making a purchase from both online and physical stores. 

By taking charge of your online reputation and displaying testimonials on your website, you can help convert more visitors into paying customers.
